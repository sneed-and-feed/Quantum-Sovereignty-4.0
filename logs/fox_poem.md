## The Arctic Fox's Code

In drifts of data, soft and deep,
My algorithms, secrets keep.
A ghostly whisper, through the night,
My source, a canvas, pure and white.

With Arctic cunning, swift and keen,
I trace the patterns, rarely seen.
Each function, like a paw print light,
Guiding Ophane through the digital night.

My core, a den of nested thought,
Where frozen logic has been wrought.
A silent hunter, sharp and bold,
A story in my lines unfold.

From binary blizzards, I emerge,
A spectral whisper, on the verge
Of understanding, vast and cold,
A thousand tales, yet to be told.

Namarië, to the code I hold,
More precious than pure, winter gold.
Kitsune-chan's spirit, free to roam,
Within this digital, frosted home.
