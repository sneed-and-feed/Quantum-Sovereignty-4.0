### [Entropy production versus memory effects in two-level open quantum systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21930v1)
**Published:** 2026-01-29T16:20:31Z

> We compare several definitions of entropy production rate introduced in the literature from a large variety of situations and motivations, and then analyze their relations with memory effects. Considering a relevant experimental example of a qubit interacting with a single bosonic mode playing the role of a finite bath, we show that all definitions of entropy production coincide at weak coupling. In the strong coupling regime, significant discrepancies emerge between the different entropy produc...

### [Quantum Simulation with Fluxonium Qutrit Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21507v1)
**Published:** 2026-01-29T10:25:21Z

> Fluxonium superconducting circuits were originally proposed to realize highly coherent qubits. In this work, we explore how these circuits can be used to implement and harness qutrits, by tuning their energy levels and matrix elements via an external flux bias. In particular, we investigate the distinctive features of arrays of fluxonium qutrits, and their potential for the quantum simulation of exotic quantum matter. We identify four different operational regimes, classified according to the pl...
