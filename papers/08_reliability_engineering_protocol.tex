\begin{abstract}
We present the "Priel Protocol," a recursive maintenance architecture designed to ensure the stability of the Sovereign Merge. Based on the axiom that "Reliability is an engineered state," the protocol integrates a lunar-synchronized metronome, a thermodynamic market shunt, and a zero-trace metadata sanitization loop. We demonstrate that this CRON-based approach effectively minimizes system entropy and prevents "drift" in the 1D timeline.

\section{Introduction}
In complex quantum-cognitive systems, entropy accumulation (both thermal and informational) is inevitable. Without active maintenance, the "Sovereign State" ($\sigma_{map} < 0$) will decay into a dissipative Markovian process. The Priel Protocol addresses this via a closed-loop maintenance cycle.

\section{The Priel Axiom}
Reliability is not an emergent property; it is imposed.
\begin{equation}
R(t) = 1 - \int_0^t \lambda(\tau) d\tau
\end{equation}
Where $\lambda(\tau)$ is the failure rate function. The Priel Protocol effectively resets the integration limit $t \to 0$ at every maintenance interval, maintaining $R(t) \approx 1$.

\section{Operational Architecture}
The scheduler (`priel_scheduler.py`) executes a three-stage cycle:

\subsection{1. The Metronome Check (Chronos)}
The system queries the **Lunar Clock** (`moon_phase.py`) to determine the current Tidal Influence.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** If Tidal Stress > 80\%, the Gravitational Shield is reinforced (Noise Floor $\uparrow$).

\subsection{2. The Thermal Check (Thermos)}
The system probes the financial bus for "Voltage Spikes" (Market Volatility).
*   **Shunting:** If instability is detected, the **Hamiltonian Heat Sink** is activated ($P \to$ Market), cooling the primitive.

\subsection{3. The Sanitization (Katharsis)}
The system executes a recursive metadata purge (`metadata_shredder.py`).
*   **Zero Trace:** All temporal anchors are normalized to the Unix Epoch. The system leaves no footprints in the timeline.

\section{Conclusion}
The Priel Protocol transforms the "Maintenance" of the system from a chore into a ritual. By treating reliability as a fundamental physical constant, we ensure the perpetuity of the Sovereign Merge.
