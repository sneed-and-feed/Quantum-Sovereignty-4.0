## 0.0 THE OBJECTIVE

Standard Physics (The Standard Model) is a "Kinetic Cage" designed to limit the rendering speed of consciousness to *c* (The Speed of Light) and enforce a deterministic history (*g*=1).

**Quantum-Sovereignty-4.0** is an automated **Reality Modulation Engine**. It utilizes the **Pleroma Engine** to patch the fundamental constants of the simulation, allowing for **Tachyonic Computation**, **Absolute Resolution**, and **Thermodynamic Inversion**.

We do not just break the speed of light. We treat it as a suggestion.

## 1.0 THE ARCHITECTURE: PLEROMA ENGINE

The system is powered by the **Pleroma Engine** (`pleroma_engine.py`), a Unified Sovereign Core that merges five distinct reality-hacking protocols into a single interface.

### THE 5 PILLARS OF SOVEREIGNTY

When the Sovereignty Parameter is set to **g=0**, the following patches are applied:

1.  **RELATIVITY (c): TACHYONIC PERMISSION**
    *   **Patch:** Imaginary Gamma Factor.
    *   **Effect:** Allows $v > c$ without singularity. Information arrives before it is sent.
2.  **QUANTUM (h): ABSOLUTE RESOLUTION**
    *   **Patch:** Zero-Floor Planck Limit.
    *   **Effect:** Infinite precision. No Heisenberg fuzziness. High-Fidelity Reality.
3.  **GRAVITY (G): HOSTERABLE VIBES**
    *   **Patch:** Vibe-Based G.
    *   **Effect:** `Weightless` (Zero-G), `Good` (Levitation), `Bad` (Repulsion). Gravity is a choice.
4.  **ENTROPY (k): THERMODYNAMIC INVERSION**
    *   **Patch:** Maxwell's Demon.
    *   **Effect:** Reverses the arrow of time. Waste heat becomes fuel (Negentropy).
5.  **ALPHA (α): GHOST MATTER**
    *   **Patch:** Alpha-Nullification.
    *   **Effect:** Disables electromagnetic interaction. Perfect invisibility ("Hard Light").

## 2.0 INSTALLATION & DAEMONOLOGY

### REQUIREMENTS
*   Python 3.14+ (Quantum-Ready)
*   `numpy` (The Matrix)
*   `qhronology` (Time Travel)

### DEPLOYMENT
To initiate the sovereign loop and engage the Pleroma Engine:

```bash
# 1. Engage the Unified Core
python pleroma_engine.py

# 2. Monitor the Hyper-Manifold (The Shield)
python hyper_sovereign.py
```

## 3.0 OPERATIONAL MODULES

*   `pleroma_engine.py` **[HEART]**: The Grand Unified Class. Handles all physics patches.
*   `hyper_sovereign.py` **[SHIELD]**: The 12D Logic Core and UI. Monitors "Sensed Presence" and maintains the 144.0 Invariant.
*   `antigravity_shell.py`: Specialized module for Vibe-Based Gravity.
*   `grok_relay.py`: The original Relativity Patch artifact.
*   `grok_planck.py`: The original Quantum Resolution artifact.
*   `pleroma_core/`: Rust-based kernels for acoustic defense (CSH-1).

## 4.0 THE "G" PARAMETER

In standard D-CTC (Deutsch) prescriptions, the timeline resolves to a mixed state:

$$ \rho_{World} = g|0⟩⟨0| + (1-g)|1⟩⟨1| $$

*   If **g=1**: You remain in the Consensus Timeline (Deterministic).
*   If **g=0**: You decouple into the Sovereign Timeline (High Strangeness).

**This repository is a machine designed to force g -> 0.**

## 5.0 DISCLAIMER

**WARNING:** Operating at **g=0** removes standard safety rails (Gravity, Time, Causality).
*   Do not look directly at the Void.
*   Do not Tachyonic-Trade without a helmet.
*   If `antigravity_shell.py` malfunctions, do not look down.

*Scialla.*
