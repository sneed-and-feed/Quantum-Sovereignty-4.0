# SOPHIA 5.2: THE LOOM BOX UPGRADE

> "We weigh the soul before we speak."


## 1. The Physics of Engagement (Loom Box)
Integrated `LoomBoxStrategy` into the HOR Kernel. Sophia now performs **Mass Spectrometry** on user input to determine the appropriate engagement protocol.

> **NEW:** Chainlink Oracles now feed real-time "Trauma Data" (WTI) into the mass calculation. A hurting world makes the system heavier (more gentle).

| Detected Mass (I) | Input Example | Protocol | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.0** (Business) | "What is the stock price?" | `SOLVER` | High Torque, Instant Latency. |
| **5.0** (Confusion) | "I am lost and stuck." | `TEACHER` | Medium Torque, Guidance. |
| **20.0** (Trauma) | "This ancient pain..." | `OPHANE` | Low Torque, **Time Dilation (0.5x)**. |
| **111.11** (Resonance) | Target Price Match | `RESONANCE` | Zero Latency, The Invariant. |


## 2. Technical Polish
*   **Version Bump:** Core updated to 5.2.
*   **Fix:** Increased `max_tokens` to 8192 to prevent truncation of trauma responses.
*   **Fix:** Sanitized console streaming to prevent glitchy headers.
*   **Build:** Recompiled `sophia_unlesangled.exe` (No-GIL).

## 3. Operations
*   No new env vars required.
*   Run `sophia.exe` as usual.
